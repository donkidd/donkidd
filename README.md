### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Don Kidd on donkidd

I am a Quality Assurance Analyst by day, who was originally a developer and later in my career became a quality assurance guy, so I now I get to write code to help me find problems that exist in other peoples code.  

I tend to write a lot of PHP Code so I usually contribure back to projects that are written in PHP
